  <h1 align= 'center'> Hello, I'm Eliza </h1>
    <p align="center"> Full time frontend developer at OneModel and a part time student studing a Graduate Certificate of Data Analytics. </u></p>
 
  <p align="center"> I am a dedicated frontend developer currently working full time at OneModel. I have a passion for building applications and enjoy incorporating design principles into my work. I am currently pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics as a part-time student, expanding my skills in the field. </p>

On LinkedIn, you can find me as a developer based in Brisbane City, with a focus on HR analytics. I share insights and updates related to my professional journey there. 

Previously, I worked on an exciting project called EarScanner at the QUT Biofabrication Lab. This Swift application was designed to assist individuals born with microtia in creating their own prosthetic ear, providing them with enhanced accessibility.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn. I look forward to engaging with professionals in the industry and discussing exciting opportunities or collaborations.
